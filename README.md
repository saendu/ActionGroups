# ActionGroups
Action Groups is a Trisub (Trigger/Subscription) Pattern that allows to attach (subscribe) Funcs to a group that can be triggered. The trigger action can be enforced at a later stage and does simply invoke all attached Funcs.

A common use case of this model is to connect losely coupled funcs with each other. An example of such a model would be the the clearance of a Server-side cache.
